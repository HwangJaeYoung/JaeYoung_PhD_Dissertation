    \centering Scalability & 
    \doitems   
        \item Pros: This is highly scalable if a single standard is mandated.
        \item Cons: It is difficult to mandate that all cities follow the same standard. & 
    \doitems   
        \item Pros: Interconnected smart cities can easily be extended using PIC.
        \item Cons: It is not easy to develop PIC for all standards. &
    \doitems   
        \item Pros: The use of semantics ensures scalability. 
        \item Cons: It is difficult to develop annotators for all standards. \\
        
    \hline
    \centering Complexity & 
    \doitems   
        \item Pros: A standard body only needs to define standardized mutual registration procedures. & 
    \doitems   
        \item Cons: As interworking cities grow, the complexity grows steeply. & 
    \doitems   
        \item Pros: Each city only needs to provide an annotator for the common ontology.
        \item Cons: The common ontology can become complicated. \\
        
    \hline
    \centering Data redundancy & 
    \doitems   
        \item Cons: All data on a platform should be replicated on a remote platform. & 
    \doitems   
        \item Pros: A platform only needs to have data that it interworks with. & 
    \doitems   
        \item Pros: The meta-cloud only needs to store the semantic description. 
        \item Cons: All data should be annotated and stored in the meta-cloud. \\
        
    \hline
    \centering Development effort \& cost & 
    \doitems   
        \item Platform developers take on a small burden. Application developers only need to use the standardized APIs. & 
    \doitems   
        \item Platform developers have to develop PICs while App developers just need to know their city APIs. & 
    \doitems   
        \item Each city platform owner has to develop annotators, while App developers only need to use given APIs. \\
        
    \hline
    \centering {Privacy \& security} & 
    \doitems   
        \item Pros: High probability that two cities are using the
                                       same security mechanism. & 
    \doitems   
        \item Cons: May need security mechanisms for secure interworking. & 
    \doitems   
        \item Cons: Additional common security mechanisms need to be defined. \\
